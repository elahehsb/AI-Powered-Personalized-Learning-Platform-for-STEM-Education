# AI-Powered-Personalized-Learning-Platform-for-STEM-Education

### Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered personalized learning platform specifically tailored for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. The platform will leverage machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics to offer personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and adaptive content recommendations to students.

### Project Goals
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess educational content and student interaction data.
###### Machine Learning Models: Implement models for personalized learning path recommendations and student performance prediction.
###### Natural Language Processing: Develop NLP models to understand student queries and generate context-aware responses.
###### Interactive Interface: Create an engaging web interface for students and educators.
###### Deployment and Scalability: Deploy the platform using modern containerization and orchestration tools to ensure scalability.

### System Architecture
###### Data Collection: Collect data from educational resources, online courses, and student interactions.
###### Data Storage: Use a combination of relational (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases for efficient data storage.
###### NLP Processing: Utilize advanced NLP techniques to process and respond to student queries.
###### Machine Learning: Train models to predict student performance and recommend personalized learning paths.
###### User Interface: Develop a responsive web interface using modern web technologies.
###### Deployment: Use Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and scalability.
